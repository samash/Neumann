## A basic computer made in C++

This is a really simple C++ computer simulator which will run basic assembly programs, written in a custom assembly language.
This whole project is about a *custom* CPU desgined - abstract only of course - that will run a custom assembly language.

Version 0.1: 
A basic simulation of the processor that runs instructions supplied by ther user. It also features a monitor program that facilitates in the input of the program.

The processor features:
REGISTERS:
accumulator (A), counter (C) and instruction register (I)

Memory is composed of 100 "bits."

TODO: 
1. Add the execution logic to the program
2. Add the dump function
3. Refactor!
