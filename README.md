# A Computer Simulator using C++
## A basic computer with 100 word memory and a really slow processor made in C++

This is a really simple C++ computer simulator which will run basic assembly programs, written in a custom assembly designed by me.
This whole project is about a *custom* CPU desgined by me - abstract only of course - that will run a custom assmebly language.
